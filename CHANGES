# 0.1.5 - hertogp

- renamed options to `im_<xxx>` to reduce possibility for namespace conflicts:
    + `im_out=fcb,stdout,stderr,image`  specify what to output in which order
    + `im_opt="cli options"`            add these options on the command line
    + `im_prg=cli-command`              use this command (no derive by class)

- reduce footprint of filter
    + by default pandoc-imagine now removes all of its own classes
    + all other classes are retained when outputting an image or codeblock

- fixed some pylint warnings (len(sequence) for example...)

# 0.1.4 - hertogp

- `pay_the_pypir.awk` to fix README.rst for PYPI

    + make urls for images on github absolute
