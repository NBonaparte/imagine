# Imagine

A pandoc filter that wraps around a number of external command line utilities
used to turn a fenced codeblock into graphics or ascii art.

Commands include:

   actdiag, blockdiag, boxes, circo, ditaa, dot, fdp, figlet, gnugraph,
   graph, graphviz, imagine, mermaid, mscgen, neato, nwdiag, packetdiag,
   pic, pic2plot, plantuml, plot, protocol, rackdiag, seqdiag, sfdp,
   twopi

## Installation

1. Put `imagine.py` anywhere along $PATH (pandoc's search path for filters).
2. % sudo pip install (mandatory):
     - pandocfilters
3. % sudo apt-get install (1 or more of):
     - graphviz,   http://graphviz.org
     - plantuml,   http://plantuml.com
     - ditaa,      http://ditaa.sourceforge.net
     - figlet,     http://www.figlet.org
     - plotutils,  https://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/
     - gnuplot,    http://www.gnuplot.info/
   % sudo pip install:
     - blockdiag,  http://blockdiag.com
   % git clone
     - https://github.com/luismartingarcia/protocol.git

## Pandoc usage

  % pandoc --filter imagine.py document.md -o document.pdf


## Markdown usage

                 or                               or
    ```cmd       | ```{.cmd options="extras"}     | ```{.. prog=cmd}
    source       | source                         | source
    ```          | ```                            | ```
    simple         with `options`                   with `prog`

  Image understands/consumes these fenced codeblock key,val-attributes:
  - `options` use this to feed extra arguments to the external command
  - `prog`    use this when cmd is not an appropiate class for you
  - `keep`    if True, keeps a reconstructued copy of the original CodeBlock

  Notes:
  - if cmd is not found, the codeblock is kept as-is.
  - input/output filenames are generated from a hash of the fenced codeblock.
  - subdir `pd-images` is used to store input/output files
  - if an output filename exists, it is not regenerated but simply linked to.
  - `packetdiag` & `sfdp`s underlying libraries seem to have some problems.


## How Imagine works

The general format for an external command looks something like:

%% cmd <options> <inputfile> <outputfile>

Input/Output filenames are generated using `pandocfilters.get_filename4code`
supplying both the codeblock and its attributes as a string for hashing. If
the input file doesn't exist it is generated by writing the code in the fenced
codeblock. Hence, if you change the code and/or the attributes, new files will
result.

Imagine does no clean up so, after a while, you might want to clear the
`pd-images` directory.

Some commands are Imagine's aliases for system commands.  Examples are
`graphviz` which is an alias for `dot` and `pic` which is an alias for
`pic2plot`.  Mainly because that allows the alias names to be used as a cmd
for a fenced codeblock (ie. ```graphviz to get ```dot)

Some commands like `figlet` or `boxes` produce output on stdout.  This text is
captured and used to replace the code in the fenced code block.

Some commands like `pic2plot (or its alias `pic`) interpret the code in the
fenced code block as an input filename to convert to some other output format.

If a command fails for some reason, the fenced codeblock is kept as is.  In
that case, the output produced by Imagine on stderr hopefully provides some
usefull info.


## Security

Imagine just wraps some commands and provides no checks.

So use it with care and make sure you understand the fenced codeblocks before
running it through the filter.


## Imagine command

Finally, a quick way to read this help text again, is to include a fenced
codeblock in your markdown document as follows:

  ```imagine
  ```

  That's it, enjoy!
